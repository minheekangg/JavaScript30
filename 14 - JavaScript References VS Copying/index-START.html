    // start with strings, numbers and booleans
    let age = 20;
    let ageCopy = age;
    age = 30; 
    console.log(age, ageCopy); // will return  (30, 20) bc ageCopy copied age when it was 20!!!!

    let name = 'wes';
    let nameCopy = name;
    name = 'diff name';
    console.log(name, nameCopy) // ('diff name', 'wes') for the same reason as above!

    // Let's say we have an array
    const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];
    const team = players;
    team[3] = 'Lux';
    //console.log(team, players); 
    //UPDATES COPY + ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

    // and we want to make a copy of it.

    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way
    const copyOfTeam = team.slice();
    copyOfTeam[0] = 'NEW NAME WOAH'
    console.log(team, copyOfTeam);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const copy2Team = [].concat(team);
    copy2Team[0] = "NEW NAME COPY";
    console.log('copy 2', copy2Team, team);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const copy3Team = [...team];
    copy3Team[0] = "THIRD NAME COPY";
    console.log('copy 3', copy3Team, team);


    const copy4Team = Array.from(team);
    copy4Team[0] = "FOURTH NAME COPY";
    console.log('copy 4', copy4Team, team);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
    const personCopy = person;
    personCopy['third'] = 3;
    console.log('incorrect copy', person, personCopy);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
     const personRealCopy =  Object.assign({}, person, {newKey: 'newValue'});
    console.log('correct obj copy', person, personRealCopy);
   

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
